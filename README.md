### hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm <b> <i> Julia, </i> </b> a Junior Software Tester. I spent a solid 1.5 years as a Junior Frontend Developer, where I stumbled upon the world of manual testing as part of my daily duties and it sparked a whole new passion in me.
<br><br>
I decided to dive into testing wholeheartedly. To solidify my skills, I earned the ISTQB Foundation Level certification. Now, I'm on the lookout for opportunities in both manual and automated testing, particularly in Cypress or Playwright. I believe my unique blend of development and testing experience gives me a well-rounded perspective to contribute effectively to any testing team.

Let's build quality together! ðŸš€
