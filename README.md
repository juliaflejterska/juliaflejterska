### Hi there! 👋 
I'm <b><i>Julia,</i> </b> and I'm a <b>Software Tester</b> 👩‍💻
<br><br>
My journey in IT began as a Junior Frontend Developer, where I spent 1.5 years honing my skills in coding. During this time, I found myself increasingly drawn towards quality assurance tasks, which gradually became a significant part of my job responsibilities.
<br><br>
I decided to dive into testing wholeheartedly. To solidify my skills, I earned the <b>ISTQB FL certification</b>. Currently, I work as a <b>QA Specialist</b>, testing both web and mobile applications. While <b>manual testing</b> forms a significant part of my role, I'm also actively expanding my expertise in <b>automated testing in Cypress and Playwright</b>. 
<br><br>
I believe my unique blend of development and testing experience gives me a well-rounded perspective to contribute effectively to any testing team.
<br><br>
Let's build quality together! 🚀
